Scrolex is a high-performance PDF viewer specifically optimized for HiDPI
displays and designed for distraction-free, efficient reading. With its
horizontal scrolling layout, Scrolex lets you see more pages at once, making it
ideal for large monitors and wide screens.

## Features

1. Horizontal Scrolling Layout

    Main Feature: Unlike traditional viewers, Scrolex uses a horizontal scroll
    layout along the X-axis. This layout lets users easily view multiple pages
    side by side, especially on widescreen or HiDPI monitors. It offers a
    refreshing and seamless reading experience for long documents.

2. Margin Cropping

    Scrolex includes a feature to crop document margins, allowing even more
    content to fit on-screen without unnecessary whitespace.

3. Scroll Wheel for Page Navigation

    Intuitive Navigation: Along with keyboard navigation Scrolex supports a
    simple scroll wheel action for moving between pages. Each scroll of the
    wheel moves the document one page to the left or right, offering quick and
    effortless navigation. This design choice minimizes interruptions and
    distractions, making it easy to stay focused on reading without needing to
    search for the needed keyboard key.

4. Wayland Support

    Scrolex offers full Wayland support, ensuring compatibility with modern
    Linux systems. Whether you're using X11 or Wayland, Scrolex will run
    smoothly.
